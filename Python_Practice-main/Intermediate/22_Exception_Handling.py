# Types of Errors

# 1. Compile Time Errors  --> Syntax Errors
# 2. Logical Errors       --> Logical Mistake Where the code will Execute and gives the Output
#                             But Does not Give the exact Output Required.
# 3. Runtime Errors       --> The Moment we get A Runtime Error the Execution of the Program Will Stop
