# 1. None       -> When a Variable is not assigned None to it then it is Called as None Type
# 2. Numeric    -> A. int       --> Integer Data
#               -> B. float     --> Floating Point Data or Decimal Values
#               -> C. Complex   --> Combination of Variables or Values with alphabets   Ex:- a+bj or 6+9j
#               -> D. bool      --> True or False
# 3. List       -> Collection of a List of Elements of any Data Type and It is Mutable
# 4. Tuple      -> Collection of Different Types of Elements Which will be Immutable
# 5. Set        -> Set is a Collection of Non-Duplicate Data and it is also Immutable
# 6. String     -> String is Data Type Which is used to represent String Type of Data and it is Immutable
# 7. Range      -> Range Function Only works with integers or whole numbers. It will give output
# of the integers range that we select
# 8. Dictionary -> It is set of Key-Value Pairs and it does not allow duplicate Values and Dictionaries are Unordered
